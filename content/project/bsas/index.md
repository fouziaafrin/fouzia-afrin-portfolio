The **Biometric Student Attendance System (BSAS)** is a biometric-based attendance system designed for university settings. It allows students to record their attendance via fingerprint scanning, while teachers and administrators can manage attendance, class schedules, and notifications.

This system is built with the aim to enhance attendance tracking efficiency and manage leave requests for students and teachers.
