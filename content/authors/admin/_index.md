## About Me

Hi! I’m a curious and passionate CSE student with a knack for solving problems and building projects. I have experience with C, C++, Java, and web development, and I’m always excited to learn new technologies.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me immersed in a good book, exploring the art of crafts and origami, or geeking out over algorithms. My current focus is on creating innovative solutions and refining my skills one project at a time.

Let’s connect and create something awesome together!
