    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a curious and passionate CSE student with a knack for solving problems and building projects. I have experience with C, C++, Java, and web development, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me immersed in a good book, exploring the art of crafts and origami, or geeking out over algorithms. My current focus is on creating innovative solutions and refining my skills one project at a time.

Letâ€™s connect and create something awesome together!
