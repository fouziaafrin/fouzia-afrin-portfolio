## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a curious and passionate CSE student with a knack for solving problems and building projects. I have experience with C, C++, Java, and web development, and Iâ€™m always excited to learn new technologies.

When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me immersed in a good book, exploring the art of crafts and origami, or geeking out over algorithms. My current focus is on creating innovative solutions and refining my skills one project at a time.

Letâ€™s connect and create something awesome together!
