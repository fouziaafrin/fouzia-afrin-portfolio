abstract: |
  Soil, air, water—everywhere we use information technologies in daily life. Development of a country, health, education, and even national security depend on modern technologies. We use them so inextricably that it seems there are no alternative ways to replace a technological lifestyle. This is quite true.
  Undoubtedly, it is necessary to use data—no one can deny this—but the hard truth is, this is what threatens safety. All that exists has a certain bundle of data, and those data give us specific information. Thus, we can know and learn about our surroundings. And when we know something, its safety is compromised. Either we can act as its savior or harm it.
  As a developing country, the people of Bangladesh are digitalizing themselves in the race of modern civilizations around the world. The use of modern technologies is gradually increasing. Each day, they wake up more digitalized than the previous day. People in the country are growing their knowledge regarding digital technologies. However, not everyone can cope with the regular devices that humans usually use. Although a significant portion of people use technology at the office, home, or outside, there are still gaps in awareness.
  Living in the 21st century is very blissful due to the facilities provided by modern technologies—accessibility, usability, virtual reality, and more. However, there are also many bad deeds done by malicious individuals, whom we call hackers. Here, we come to the point of awareness when using modern technologies. Every step we take on the internet must be sensible. Otherwise, anything can happen depending on our lost data. The final fact is that our safety depends on how prudently we use the internet and avoid cyber threats.
