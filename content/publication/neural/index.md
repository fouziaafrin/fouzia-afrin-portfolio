abstract: |
  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a subfield of machine learning that has revolutionized the field of machine translation. It involves the use of neural networks to automatically translate text from one language to another. This research paper provides an overview of NMT, including its architecture, training, evaluation metrics, applications, and challenges. We first provide a brief history of NMT and its importance, followed by a literature review of related work. We then describe the NMT architecture in detail, including its components such as the encoder, decoder, attention mechanism, and optimization algorithm. Next, we discuss the training and optimization of NMT, including preprocessing, training techniques, and optimization methods. We also provide an overview of evaluation metrics used for NMT, including their strengths and weaknesses. The paper then delves into the applications of NMT, including translation of languages, speech recognition, and image captioning. Finally, we conclude by discussing the challenges in NMT, such as handling rare words, low-resource languages, and domain-specific knowledge, and suggest directions for future research.
